# Navigation and Ships — The Technology of Exploration

## The Landscape

Every explorer entry in this directory describes routes and consequences. This entry describes what made the routes possible: the instruments, the ships, the charts, and the provisioning systems. Exploration is an engineering problem before it is an adventure story. You cannot sail to India if you cannot determine where India is relative to your current position, if your ship cannot survive the open ocean, or if your crew dies of scurvy before arrival.

## Part I: Navigation

### The Core Problem

Navigation answers four questions:

```
  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  1. WHERE AM I?       → Position (latitude, longitude)│
  │  2. WHICH WAY?        → Heading (compass bearing)    │
  │  3. HOW FAR?          → Distance traveled            │
  │  4. WHERE IS THE GOAL?→ Chart (map of destinations)  │
  ├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │  Solve all four → you can navigate.                   │
  │  Fail any one  → you are lost, or you miss landfall.  │
  └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Before ~1760, navigators could solve (1) for latitude but not longitude, could solve (2) with the magnetic compass (but with systematic error), could estimate (3) with dead reckoning (but with accumulated drift), and had (4) only for previously charted waters. Open-ocean navigation before the chronometer was a controlled gamble.

### Latitude: The Easy Coordinate

Latitude was solvable from antiquity because the sky provides a direct reference.

**Polaris Method (Northern Hemisphere)**

The altitude of Polaris above the horizon equals your latitude, within about 1 degree. Polaris is not exactly at the celestial pole — it traces a small circle (~0.7 degrees radius in the modern era) — but for practical navigation, sighting Polaris with a cross-staff or astrolabe gave usable latitude.

```
POLARIS ALTITUDE = LATITUDE
================================

    Zenith (90°)
      │
      │
      │       * Polaris
      │      /
      │     /  altitude angle = φ (latitude)
      │    /
      │   /
      │  /
      │ /
      │/______________ Horizon (0°)
    Observer

  At the equator (0°N):  Polaris sits on the horizon (0° altitude).
  At London (51.5°N):    Polaris is 51.5° above the horizon.
  At the North Pole (90°N): Polaris is directly overhead.

  Measurement instruments (chronological):
    Cross-staff  (medieval)  → hold stick at arm's length, slide crossbar
    Astrolabe    (ancient)   → graduated disc, sight along arm (alidade)
    Quadrant     (15th c.)   → quarter-circle, plumb line reads angle
    Backstaff    (Davis, 1594) → face away from sun, shadow-based
    Octant       (Hadley, 1731) → double-reflection, reads to ~1 arcminute
    Sextant      (1757→)     → refined octant, 60° arc, micrometer drum
```

**Noon Sun Method (Both Hemispheres)**

When Polaris is invisible (south of the equator, or cloudy northern sky), latitude comes from the sun's altitude at local noon — the moment the sun crosses the local meridian and reaches its highest point.

```
NOON SUN LATITUDE CALCULATION
================================

  Step 1: Measure the sun's maximum altitude (H) with a sextant.
  Step 2: Look up the sun's declination (δ) for today's date in tables.
          (Declination = sun's angular distance from the celestial equator.
           Ranges from +23.44° at summer solstice to −23.44° at winter solstice.)
  Step 3: Calculate:

          Latitude = 90° − H + δ

  EXAMPLE:
    Date: March 21 (equinox, δ = 0°).
    Noon sun altitude measured: 55°.
    Latitude = 90° − 55° + 0° = 35°N (or 35°S — need to know which hemisphere).

  EXAMPLE:
    Date: June 21 (summer solstice, δ = +23.44°).
    Noon sun altitude: 72°.
    Latitude = 90° − 72° + 23.44° = 41.44°N.

  Accuracy: ±10 nautical miles with a good sextant and correct tables.
  This was the standard method from the 16th century onward.
```

**Declination Tables**: The critical infrastructure. Without printed tables of solar declination for every day of the year, the noon sun method is unusable. The Portuguese *Regimento do Astrolábio e do Quadrante* (~1509) was one of the first navigational almanacs. By the 18th century, the British *Nautical Almanac* (first published 1767 by Nevil Maskelyne) became the standard reference — updated annually.

---

### Longitude: The Hard Coordinate

Latitude has a natural reference (the equator, defined by the Earth's rotation axis). Longitude has no natural reference — every meridian is identical. The choice of a prime meridian (Greenwich, since 1884) is a convention. But the deeper problem is measurement.

```
WHY LONGITUDE IS HARD
=======================

  Latitude  → angle from the equator → observable from the sky.
  Longitude → angle from an arbitrary meridian → requires TIMING.

  The Earth rotates 360° in 24 hours = 15° per hour.
  If you know the time at your current position AND the time at
  a reference meridian (e.g., Greenwich), the difference in hours
  × 15° = your longitude.

  EXAMPLE:
    Local noon occurs at 14:00 GMT → you are 2 hours west of Greenwich.
    2 hours × 15°/hour = 30°W longitude.

  THE CATCH:
    You need an accurate clock set to Greenwich time.
    A clock that gains or loses 1 minute/day → 15 nautical miles
    of longitude error per day.
    On a 60-day Atlantic crossing: 900 nm of accumulated error.
    That is the width of the Mediterranean.
```

**Methods Attempted**

| Method | Principle | Accuracy | Problem |
|--------|-----------|----------|---------|
| Dead reckoning | Estimate speed + heading → integrate | ±50–200 nm after weeks | Cumulative drift, current unknown |
| Lunar distance | Angle between Moon and reference star → compute GMT | ±30 nm (skilled observer) | Requires 30 min of computation per sight |
| Jupiter's moons | Galileo (1612): eclipses of Io as a universal clock | Good on land | Ship motion makes telescope observation impossible |
| Magnetic variation | Map variation → look up longitude | Poor | Variation changes over time (secular variation) |
| **Chronometer** | Carry accurate GMT clock | ±1–2 nm | Requires a clock accurate to ~3 sec/day at sea |

**The Lunar Distance Method**

Before the chronometer, the only workable ocean method for longitude was the lunar distance — measuring the angular distance between the Moon and a reference star (or the Sun), then using tables to compute what time it is at Greenwich.

```
LUNAR DISTANCE METHOD
=======================

  The Moon moves ~13° per day against the background stars
  (it orbits the Earth once every ~27.3 days).

  Step 1: Measure the angular distance between the Moon's limb
          and a known star (or the Sun) with a sextant.
  Step 2: Correct for parallax and refraction ("clearing the distance").
  Step 3: Enter the Nautical Almanac tables: find which GMT
          corresponds to this Moon-star distance for today's date.
  Step 4: Compare GMT to local time (from noon sun observation).
  Step 5: Difference × 15° = longitude.

  TIME REQUIRED: ~30 minutes of measurement + ~30 minutes of spherical
  trigonometry computation. One mistake → start over.

  ACCURACY: ±0.5° longitude (±30 nm) in skilled hands.
  This was the standard method from ~1767 until chronometers became
  affordable (~1850).
```

**Harrison's Chronometers**

The British Parliament's Longitude Act (1714) offered up to £20,000 (roughly £3–4 million today) for a method of determining longitude at sea to within 30 nautical miles after a six-week voyage. The astronomers (led by the Astronomer Royal, Nevil Maskelyne) believed the solution was the lunar distance method. John Harrison, a self-taught Yorkshire clockmaker, spent 31 years proving it was a clock.

```
HARRISON'S CHRONOMETERS
=========================

  H1 (1735): First marine timekeeper. 34 kg. Two interconnected
             balances (temperature-compensated). Tested 1736 on
             HMS Centurion to Lisbon. Worked, but Harrison wasn't
             satisfied. Never submitted for the prize.

  H2 (1739): Improved H1. 39 kg. Never tested at sea. Harrison
             identified fundamental design problems.

  H3 (1757): 19 years of work. Circular balances with bimetallic
             strip for temperature compensation. Still too large.
             Led Harrison to a radical insight: a large watch might
             work better than a small clock.

  H4 (1759): A WATCH. 13 cm diameter. 1.45 kg.
             Diamond pallets. Temperature-compensated balance spring.
             Tested 1761 on HMS Deptford to Jamaica (81 days).
             Lost only 5.1 seconds. That's 1.25 nautical miles.
             The prize required 30 nm. Harrison exceeded it by 24×.

  THE POLITICS:
    The Board of Longitude (chaired by Maskelyne, who championed
    the competing lunar distance method) refused to pay the full
    prize. Harrison received partial payments. Parliament eventually
    intervened. Harrison received his full reward in 1773, aged 80,
    one year before his death.

    The chronometer won. By 1800, every major navy carried them.
    Maskelyne's lunar distance method survived as a backup and check.

  H4 TIMELINE:
    ┌────┬────┬────┬────┬────┬────┬────┐

```

**Bridge: Navigation as State Estimation Under Uncertainty**

```
NAVIGATION ←→ MODERN STATE ESTIMATION

  combining predictions (dead reckoning / odometry) with
  observations (celestial fix / GPS fix) to bound error growth.

  Dead reckoning error grows as √t (random walk).
  Fix observations reset the error.
  Navigation = managing the interval between fixes.
```

### The Magnetic Compass

The compass arrived in European navigation around the 12th–13th century, probably transmitted from China (where it was known by the 11th century) via Arab intermediaries. It was the first instrument that gave heading independent of celestial visibility — essential for overcast skies and night sailing.

**Declination vs. Deviation**

```
COMPASS ERRORS: TWO DISTINCT PROBLEMS
========================================

  MAGNETIC NORTH ≠ TRUE NORTH ≠ COMPASS NORTH

  1. DECLINATION (variation):
     Angle between TRUE NORTH and MAGNETIC NORTH.
     Caused by: Earth's magnetic field not aligning with rotation axis.
     Changes with: position on Earth (spatial variation) and
                   time (secular variation — the field drifts).
     Modern range: ±25° depending on location.

     True North
       │
       │  ← declination angle (e.g., 10°W)
       │ /
       │/
       Magnetic North

     Isogonic lines: contours of equal declination on a chart.
     Agonic line: declination = 0° (magnetic and true north align).

  2. DEVIATION:
     Angle between MAGNETIC NORTH and COMPASS NORTH.
     Caused by: iron on the ship (cannons, engines, hull fittings).
     Changes with: ship's heading (deviation is different on every course).
     Corrected by: deviation card (measured for each ship by swinging ship).

     Magnetic North
       │
       │  ← deviation angle (depends on ship heading)
       │ /
       │/
       Compass North

  TOTAL ERROR: Compass reads    = True bearing + Declination + Deviation
               True bearing     = Compass reading − Declination − Deviation

  Mnemonic: "Can Dead Men Vote Twice At Elections?"
            Compass → Deviation → Magnetic → Variation → True
            (Add East, subtract West, going from Compass to True)
```

**Compass Rose Evolution**

The 32-point compass rose (N, NbE, NNE, NEbN, NE, ...) predates degree measurement. Each point = 11.25 degrees. The helmsman steered by points, not degrees. "Steer NNE" = "steer 22.5 degrees east of north." The modern compass rose shows degrees (0–360), with the old point names retained for wind directions.

```
                    N (0°/360°)
                    │
            NNW─────┼─────NNE
          NW    ·   │   ·    NE

                    │
                    S (180°)

  32 points. Each point = 11.25°.
  "Boxing the compass" = reciting all 32 points in order.
  Required of every able seaman.
```

---

### Dead Reckoning

Dead reckoning (from "deduced reckoning") estimates position by integrating speed and heading from a known starting point. It is the default navigation method — always running, always accumulating error.

**Chip Log: Measuring Speed**

```
THE CHIP LOG (invented ~1570s)
================================

  Equipment:
    Chip (wooden quarter-circle, weighted on curved edge to float upright)
    Line (knotted at intervals of 47 ft 3 in = 14.4 m)
    Sandglass (28 seconds — NOT 30)

  Procedure:
    1. Throw chip overboard from the stern.
    2. Chip floats stationary in the water (the ship sails away from it).
    3. Line pays out as ship moves forward.
    4. Turn sandglass.
    5. When sand runs out (28 sec), count how many knots passed through
       your hands.

  Result:
    Number of knots = speed in KNOTS (nautical miles per hour).

  WHY 47 ft 3 in AND 28 seconds?
    1 nautical mile = 6,076 feet.
    6,076 ft / (3600 sec / 28 sec) = 6,076 / 128.57 = 47.25 ft.
    If 1 knot interval passes in 28 seconds, the ship is moving at
    1 nautical mile per hour = 1 knot.

  This is why speed at sea is measured in knots — literally,
  counting the knots on the chip log line.
```

**Traverse Board**

```
THE TRAVERSE BOARD
====================

  A wooden board with a compass rose painted on it and
  a grid below. Used by the helmsman to record heading
  and speed at each half-hour bell during a 4-hour watch.

  ┌─────────────────────────────┐
  │         COMPASS ROSE        │
  │     (8 concentric rings     │
  │      for 8 half-hours)      │
  │     Peg in the ring at      │
  │     the compass direction   │
  │     being steered.          │
  ├─────────────────────────────┤
  │      SPEED GRID BELOW       │
  │     Holes in columns for    │
  │     speed (knots from log)  │
  │     One peg per half-hour.  │
  └─────────────────────────────┘

  At the end of each watch:
    Navigator reads the board → extracts average heading + speed.
    Plots the DR position on the chart.
    Clears the board for the next watch.

  This is manual odometry. The error accumulates because:
    - The chip log measures speed through the water, not over ground.
      Ocean currents push the ship sideways (leeway) and forward/backward.
    - Compass heading has declination + deviation errors.
    - Speed varies between log measurements.

  After 24 hours of DR with no fix: position uncertainty ~10–30 nm.
  After a week with no fix: ~50–100 nm or worse.
```

**Estimated Position vs. Fix**

```
EP VS. FIX
============

  EP (Estimated Position): from dead reckoning alone.
      Symbol on chart: a dot inside a square.
      Growing uncertainty circle around it.

  FIX: from external observation (celestial sight, landmark bearing,
       depth sounding). Resets DR error.
       Symbol on chart: a dot inside a circle.

  Running Fix: celestial sight gives a position LINE (not a point).
               Two sights at different times, advanced by DR,
               give a fix where the lines cross.

  ──── DR track ────EP────EP────EP───⊕FIX────EP────EP────
                    ↑              ↑                    ↑
               Growing error   Error reset         Growing again

  Navigation quality = how often you get fixes.
  Coastal navigation: fix every few minutes (landmarks).
  Open ocean: fix at noon (sun) and dawn/dusk (stars).
  Overcast: no fix → pure DR → growing uncertainty.
```

## Part II: Ship Design Evolution

### Ancient Vessels (3000 BCE – 500 CE)

```
HULL CONSTRUCTION: TWO TRADITIONS
====================================

  SHELL-FIRST (Mediterranean, ancient):
    Build the outer planking first.
    Shape the hull.
    Add frames (ribs) inside afterward for stiffness.
    Planks joined edge-to-edge by mortise-and-tenon joints.
    Labor-intensive. Strong. Smooth hull.
    Greek triremes, Roman merchant ships.

  FRAME-FIRST (Northern Europe, medieval → modern):
    Build the skeleton (keel + frames) first.
    Nail planking to the outside.
    Faster construction. Easier to scale up.
    Planks can overlap (clinker) or sit flush (carvel).
    Viking longships (clinker). Carracks onward (carvel).

  ┌──────────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐
  │  SHELL-FIRST     │     │  FRAME-FIRST     │

  └──────────────────┘     └──────────────────┘

  THE TRANSITION:
    Shell-first: dominant until ~7th century CE.
    Frame-first: dominant from ~10th century onward.
    Frame-first enabled larger ships at lower cost.
```

**Sail Limitation: Square Rig**

```
SQUARE SAIL: THE ANCIENT DEFAULT
===================================

  Square sails hang from a horizontal yard (spar) across the mast.
  Efficient downwind (wind directly behind the ship).
  Can sail across the wind (beam reach) with the yard braced around.
  CANNOT sail upwind. At best ~70° off the wind.

  CONSEQUENCE:
    Mediterranean: east-west routes work (prevailing westerlies).
    Going against the wind: wait for wind shift, or row.
    Ancient galleys: oars for propulsion when wind was wrong.
    Open ocean exploration impossible with square sail alone.
```

---

### Medieval Innovations (500 – 1400)

**The Lateen Sail**

The single most important innovation for exploration. The lateen (triangular) sail, developed by Arab sailors (dhow tradition), allows sailing closer to the wind — roughly 55–60 degrees off the wind direction, compared to 70+ degrees for a square rig.

```
LATEEN SAIL
=============

  Triangular sail on a long diagonal yard (lateen yard).
  The yard is as long as the ship itself.
  Pivots around the mast.

         WIND →→→→→→→→→

  ADVANTAGE: Can point closer to the wind (tacking upwind).
  DISADVANTAGE: Hard to handle in heavy weather. The long yard
    must be manhandled around the mast on every tack.
    Requires skilled crew. Dangerous in storms.

  SOLUTION: The Portuguese combined both:
    Square sails on foremast and mainmast (power downwind).
    Lateen on mizzenmast (maneuvering, pointing upwind).
    → The full-rigged ship. This combination dominated 1450–1850.
```

**The Stern-Hung Rudder**

Before the stern rudder, ships steered with a side-mounted steering oar (starboard = "steer board" side). The stern-hung rudder, appearing in Europe around 1200, was a transformation in controllability.

```
STEERING OAR vs. STERN RUDDER
================================

  STEERING OAR (ancient → ~1200):
    Mounted on the right side (starboard) of the stern.
    Effective for small ships.
    Loses effectiveness as ship size increases.
    Vulnerable to damage (projects from the hull).
    Helmsman stands at the stern.

### The Ships of Exploration (1400 – 1600)

**Caravel**

The Portuguese exploration ship. Small (50–200 tons), shallow draft, lateen-rigged (initially), fast, maneuverable. Designed for coastal exploration — sailing into unknown harbors, up rivers, and back out.

```
CARAVEL (Portuguese, 15th century)
=====================================

  Length: 15–25 m.  Beam: 5–8 m.  Draft: ~2 m.
  Displacement: 50–200 tons.  Crew: 20–30.

  CHARACTERISTICS:
    - Shallow draft → can explore rivers and coastlines.
    - Lateen rig (caravela latina) → tacks upwind along coast.
    - Later: square + lateen hybrid (caravela redonda).
    - Fast: 6–8 knots. Could outrun most threats.
    - Small: limited cargo. NOT a cargo carrier.

  TWO VARIANTS:
    Caravela latina: all lateen sails. Exploration.
    Caravela redonda: square foresail + lateen mizzen. Ocean crossings.

  Da Gama's Berrio was a caravel.
  Columbus's Niña started as lateen, re-rigged to square for Atlantic.
  The caravel was the Formula 1 car of the Age of Exploration.
```

**Carrack (Nau)**

The heavy-lift ship. Where the caravel explored, the carrack carried cargo and soldiers. 200–1,000+ tons. Three or four masts. High forecastle and aftercastle (for combat). The standard ocean-going vessel of the early 16th century.

```
CARRACK (Nau) — 15th–16th century
=====================================

  Length: 25–40 m.  Beam: 8–12 m.  Draft: 3–5 m.
  Displacement: 200–1,000+ tons.  Crew: 80–200.

  CHARACTERISTICS:
    - Full-rigged: square sails on fore + main, lateen on mizzen.
    - High castles fore and aft (fighting platforms, accommodation).
    - Deep hull: large cargo capacity.
    - Slower than caravel (4–5 knots), but far more cargo.
    - Armed: cannons mounted through gun ports.

  Columbus's Santa María was a carrack (~100 tons, small for type).
  Da Gama's São Gabriel was a carrack (~178 tons).
  Portuguese India Run carracks reached 1,000+ tons by 1550.
```

**Galleon**

Evolution of the carrack for the Atlantic and Pacific trades. Lower forecastle (better seakeeping), longer hull (faster), gun deck redesigned for broadside combat. The dominant warship and long-distance trader from ~1550–1700.

```
CARRACK → GALLEON EVOLUTION
==============================

  CARRACK (1450–1550):        GALLEON (1550–1700):
  ┌──┐                        ┌──┐

  KEY CHANGES:
    Forecastle lowered → less windage, better into the wind.
    Hull length-to-beam ratio increased → faster (4:1 → 5:1+).
    Continuous gun deck → broadside firepower.
    Finer entry lines at bow → better wave-piercing.
    Beakhead bow → boarding platform, head (toilet).

  Manila galleons crossed the Pacific (Mexico–Philippines) for 250 years.
  Spanish treasure galleons carried silver from the Americas to Spain.
  English "race-built" galleons (Drake, Hawkins): stripped down for speed.
```

---

### Age of Sail Evolution (1700 – 1870)

**Ship-of-the-Line**

The capital warship. Three masts, two or three gun decks, 60–130 cannons, 500–900 crew. Designed for fleet actions where ships formed a line and fired broadsides. Not primarily an exploration vessel, but the naval power that enabled colonial expansion.

**Clipper Ship**

The fastest commercial sailing vessels ever built. Extreme length-to-beam ratio (~6:1), sharp bow, tall rig carrying maximum canvas. Built for speed on long routes (China tea trade, Australian wool). Peak era: 1845–1870.

```
HULL SHAPE: BEAM-TO-LENGTH RATIO AND SPEED
=============================================

  VESSEL TYPE           L:B RATIO    TYPICAL SPEED
  ──────────           ─────────    ─────────────
  Carrack              ~3:1         4–5 knots
  Galleon              ~4:1         5–7 knots
  Frigate              ~4.5:1       8–10 knots
  Clipper              ~6:1         14–17 knots (peak: 21)

  Longer + narrower = faster (lower wave-making resistance).
  But: less cargo space, less stability, harder to handle.
  Clipper ships sacrificed cargo capacity for speed.

## Part III: Provisions — The Limiting Factor

### Scurvy: The Real Enemy

More sailors died of scurvy than of storms, combat, and all other diseases combined during the Age of Sail. Scurvy killed an estimated 2 million sailors between 1500 and 1800. It is caused by vitamin C deficiency; symptoms begin after 1–3 months without fresh food. Bleeding gums, then loosening teeth, then reopening of healed wounds, then death.

```
SCURVY TIMELINE
=================

  1497: Da Gama loses 100 of 170 men to scurvy on the India run.
  1520: Magellan's crew devastated crossing the Pacific (3 months).
  1593: Richard Hawkins: "sour oranges and lemons" as treatment.
        Observation. Not adopted.
  1614: John Woodall (Surgeon General, East India Company): lemon juice.
        Published in "The Surgion's Mate." Not adopted by the Navy.
  1740: Anson's circumnavigation. 1,854 men departed; ~1,400 died,
        most from scurvy. Worst losses of any voyage.
  1747: JAMES LIND — controlled trial on HMS Salisbury.
        12 scorbutic sailors, 6 treatments. Citrus worked.
        Published 1753. Navy ignored it for 42 years.
  1768: JAMES COOK — 3 voyages, no scurvy deaths.
        Used sauerkraut (vitamin C survives fermentation),
        malt wort (less effective), enforced cleanliness,
        and fresh food at every port.
  1795: British Navy mandates lemon juice rations (42 years after Lind).
        Scurvy effectively eliminated in Royal Navy.
  1867: Merchant Shipping Act: lime juice mandatory.
        "Limeys" = British sailors. (Limes have less vitamin C than
        lemons — switch from Mediterranean lemons to Caribbean limes
        caused partial resurgence of scurvy in the 1870s–80s.)
  1932: Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) isolated by Albert Szent-Györgyi.
        The molecular cause finally identified.

  THE SCANDAL:
    The cure was known in 1601 (James Lancaster, East India Company,
    used lemon juice and had zero scurvy). The mechanism was not
    understood, which let competing theories (bad air, laziness,
    "putrefaction") delay adoption for 200 years.
    Hundreds of thousands died of a solved problem.
```

### Provisioning a Ship

```
PROVISIONS FOR A 100-MAN CREW, 6-MONTH VOYAGE (~1700)
=======================================================

  ITEM                    QUANTITY          STORAGE
  ────                    ────────          ───────
  Water                   80–100 tons       Oak casks (went foul after weeks)
  Beer/wine               15–20 tons        Replacement for spoiled water
  Salt beef               15 tons           Packed in brine casks
  Salt pork               10 tons           Packed in brine casks
  Hardtack (ship biscuit) 8 tons            Dry storage (got weevils)
  Dried peas/beans        3 tons            Dry storage
  Flour                   3 tons            Barrels
  Cheese                  2 tons            Wax-coated wheels
  Butter                  1 ton             Kegs
  Oatmeal                 1.5 tons          Sacks
  Vinegar                 500 gallons       Cleaning and food preservation
  Rum/spirits             1,000+ gallons    Daily ration: 1/2 pint

  TOTAL: ~130–150 tons of provisions.
  On a 200-ton ship, provisions are 65–75% of the cargo.
  You are carrying your own fuel.

  WATER:
    The critical constraint. ~1 gallon (4L) per man per day minimum.
    100 men × 180 days × 4L = 72,000 liters = ~72 tons.
    Water went stagnant in wooden casks (no airtight seal).
    Supplemented by rainwater collection (awnings, sails).
    Beer and wine were safer to drink than stored water.

  CALORIE BUDGET:
    ~3,000–4,000 kcal/day for heavy manual labor.
    Salt meat + hardtack + peas = ~3,200 kcal, but:
    Vitamin C → zero after first month.
    Vitamin A → inadequate. Night blindness common.
    Fresh food only available at port stops.

  SPOILAGE:
    Hardtack → infested with weevils and larvae after weeks.
    (Sailors ate it in the dark to avoid seeing what was in it.)
    Salt beef → could last years but grew increasingly inedible.
    Water → green, slimy, foul-tasting. Still drinkable.
    Cheese → grew mold. Scraped and eaten.
```

## Part IV: Cartography

### From Portolan to Mercator

**Portolan Charts (13th century)**

The earliest navigation charts. Based on compass bearings and estimated distances between known ports. Accurate for the Mediterranean (small area, many reference points). Useless for open-ocean navigation because they have no projection — they treat the curved Earth as flat.

```
PORTOLAN CHART STRUCTURE
==========================

  Characteristics:
    - Compass roses (wind roses) scattered across the chart.
    - Rhumb lines radiating from each rose in 16 or 32 directions.
    - Coastlines drawn from direct observation and compass bearings.
    - Interior of landmasses: blank or decorated (no survey data).
    - Scale bars, but no latitude/longitude grid.

  ┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐

  │        INTERIOR: BLANK                    │
  └────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  Good for: Mediterranean coastal navigation.
  Bad for: ocean crossings (no latitude, no projection).
```

**Mercator Projection (1569)**

Gerardus Mercator published his world map in 1569. The key property: rhumb lines (constant compass bearing) appear as straight lines. A navigator can draw a straight line from A to B on a Mercator chart, read the compass bearing, and steer that bearing. This is not the shortest path (great circle), but it is the easiest to steer.

```
MAP PROJECTIONS: WHAT THEY PRESERVE
======================================

  MERCATOR (conformal):
    Preserves: angles and shapes (locally).
    Rhumb lines: STRAIGHT (→ easy to navigate).
    Great circles: curved (→ not shortest path).
    Distortion: area. Greenland looks as big as Africa.
                (Africa is 14× larger.)
    Use: navigation charts (still standard for marine charts).

  GNOMONIC:
    Preserves: great circles as STRAIGHT LINES.
    Use: plotting shortest ocean routes.
    Distortion: extreme near edges. Only shows <1 hemisphere.
    Technique: plot great-circle route on gnomonic chart,
               then transfer waypoints to Mercator for steering.

  EQUAL-AREA (e.g., Mollweide, Albers):
    Preserves: area (correct relative sizes).
    Distortion: shapes.
    Use: thematic maps (population, climate, resources).
    NOT used for navigation.

  COMPARISON ON A NORTH ATLANTIC ROUTE (New York → London):

    MERCATOR CHART:        GNOMONIC CHART:
    (rhumb line straight)  (great circle straight)

    ──────────────────     ╲

    ──────────────────           ╲  (shorter)
                                  ╲
    Rhumb line distance:     Great circle distance:
    ~3,459 nm                ~3,000 nm

    Saving by great-circle routing: ~460 nm (~13%).
    On longer routes the saving is proportionally larger.
```

**From WGS84 to GPS**

Modern charts reference the WGS84 datum (World Geodetic System 1984) — the same reference ellipsoid used by GPS. This means a GPS position can be plotted directly on a WGS84 chart. Older charts used local datums; plotting a GPS position on a chart with a different datum can place you hundreds of meters from your actual position — a relevant error near coastlines and shoals.

---

### Survey Methods

**Triangulation (Snellius, 1615)**

Willebrord Snellius demonstrated that you can measure the distance between two remote points by measuring angles from a known baseline rather than measuring the distance directly.

```
TRIANGULATION
===============

  Known: baseline AB (measured precisely on flat ground).
  Unknown: position of point C (a church steeple, hilltop, etc.).

        C
       ╱ ╲
      ╱   ╲
     ╱     ╲
    ╱ α     β ╲
   A───────────B
    ← baseline →
    (measured)

  Measure angle α at A (toward C) and angle β at B (toward C).
  Third angle γ = 180° − α − β.
  Law of sines: AC/sin(β) = AB/sin(γ).
  Now AC and BC are known → position of C is determined.

  THEN: use AC or BC as a new baseline → extend the triangle chain.
  Each new triangle shares a side with a previous triangle.
  Error propagation: controlled by redundant observations and adjustment.

  SNELLIUS (1615): measured the distance from Alkmaar to Bergen op Zoom
  (116 km) using a chain of 33 triangles, starting from a single
  measured baseline of ~325 meters.

  This method surveyed the world:
    French meridian survey (Cassini, 1683–1744).
    Great Trigonometric Survey of India (1802–1871).
    Ordnance Survey of Britain (1791→).
    "Survey" literally means "see over" — triangulation is the method.
```

**The Theodolite**

The instrument for precision angle measurement in surveying. A telescope mounted on two graduated circles — one horizontal (azimuth) and one vertical (elevation). Modern total stations add electronic distance measurement (laser rangefinder), replacing the baseline-and-chain method.

### Printing and Reproduction

Charts are useless if you cannot distribute copies to every ship. The history of cartographic printing is the history of making accurate copies.

```
CHART REPRODUCTION METHODS
=============================

  WOODCUT (15th century):
    Image carved into a wood block. Block inked and pressed to paper.
    Coarse detail. Lines thick. Fine coastlines impossible.
    Used for early printed maps (Ptolemy's Geography, 1477).

  COPPERPLATE ENGRAVING (16th–18th century):
    Image incised into a copper plate with a burin (engraving tool).
    Ink pressed into grooves. Paper pressed onto plate.
    Fine lines, precise detail. THE standard for nautical charts.
    Mercator's 1569 map: copperplate engraving.
    A single plate can produce ~1,000 prints before wearing out.
    Corrections: hammer out the back, re-engrave. Expensive.

  LITHOGRAPHY (1796, Senefelder):
    Image drawn on limestone with grease crayon.
    Wet stone repels ink; greasy image accepts ink.
    Faster than engraving. Easier to correct.
    Enabled color printing (chromolithography): one stone per color.
    Contour maps with color elevation shading become practical.

  OFFSET LITHOGRAPHY (1875→):
    Image transferred from plate → rubber blanket → paper.
    No direct plate-to-paper contact.
    Mass production. Modern chart printing.

## Common Confusion Points

**"Columbus proved the Earth was round."**
The spherical Earth was established knowledge among educated Europeans by the 3rd century BCE (Eratosthenes measured the circumference to within ~15%). Columbus's error was not about shape — it was about size. He underestimated the circumference by ~40% and thought Asia extended further east. No one needed to prove the Earth was round in 1492; the question was how far west you'd have to sail to reach Asia.

**"The compass points to the North Pole."**
The magnetic compass points to magnetic north, which is not the geographic North Pole. As of 2025, magnetic north is in the Canadian Arctic, ~500 km from the geographic pole, and drifting toward Siberia at ~50 km/year. The angle between true north and magnetic north (declination) varies by location — it can be 20+ degrees in some regions. Ignoring declination on a transatlantic crossing would miss your target by hundreds of miles.

**"Harrison invented the first clock."**
Harrison invented the first clock accurate enough to determine longitude at sea. Clocks existed for centuries. The problem was making one that kept time to within ~3 seconds per day despite the rolling, temperature swings, humidity, and vibration of a ship at sea. That is an engineering problem of extraordinary difficulty — every existing clock technology (pendulum, verge escapement) failed at sea. Harrison solved it with a completely new mechanism: a temperature-compensated balance spring with diamond pallets and a remontoire (constant-force device).

**"Mercator projection distorts everything."**
Mercator preserves angles (it is conformal). This means shapes of small regions are correct, and compass bearings are straight lines on the chart. It distorts area — Greenland appears enormous, Africa appears too small. For navigation, angle preservation is what matters. Mercator is still the standard for marine charts because a straight line on the chart = a constant compass course. The distortion is a trade-off, not a flaw.

**"Scurvy was unsolvable until modern medicine."**
The cure (citrus fruit) was documented in 1601 (James Lancaster), described in surgical manuals in 1614 (John Woodall), and experimentally confirmed in 1747 (James Lind). The British Navy did not mandate it until 1795 — a 42-year gap after Lind's published trial, or a 194-year gap after Lancaster's demonstration. The problem was not medical knowledge but institutional inertia, competing theories, and the low status of surgical evidence in an era that preferred "first principles" reasoning over empirical results.

**"Knots and nautical miles are arbitrary."**
A nautical mile = 1 arcminute of latitude (by definition). This links distance directly to the coordinate system: 60 nautical miles = 1 degree of latitude. A knot = 1 nautical mile per hour. The chip log's knot spacing was calculated to make this conversion automatic. The system is not arbitrary — it is the natural unit system for spherical navigation.
