# Wave Equation and Hyperbolic Systems

## The Big Picture

The wave equation u_tt = c²∇²u is the archetype of **reversible, finite-speed propagation**.
It models acoustics, electromagnetism, seismology, and is the non-relativistic limit of many
field theories. Understanding it deeply gives you the template for all hyperbolic systems.

## 1D Wave Equation: Complete Solution

```
  u_tt = c²u_xx,    u(x,0) = u₀(x),    u_t(x,0) = v₀(x)

  CHARACTERISTICS:  two families
      ξ = x + ct  (left-moving)
      η = x − ct  (right-moving)

  In (ξ,η) coordinates:  u_ξη = 0
  General solution:       u = F(ξ) + G(η) = F(x+ct) + G(x−ct)

  Apply initial conditions to find F and G:
      u(x,0) = F(x) + G(x) = u₀(x)
      u_t(x,0) = cF'(x) − cG'(x) = v₀(x)

  Integrate second equation: F(x) − G(x) = (1/c)∫₀ˣ v₀(s) ds + const

  D'ALEMBERT'S FORMULA:
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  u(x,t) = ½[u₀(x+ct) + u₀(x−ct)] + 1/(2c) ∫_{x−ct}^{x+ct} v₀(s)ds│
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  DOMAIN OF DEPENDENCE of (x,t):
      [x−ct, x+ct]  on the initial line t=0.
  Only the initial data in this interval affects u(x,t).
  Points outside: CAUSALLY DISCONNECTED from (x,t).
```

---

## Energy and Conservation

```
  ENERGY DENSITY:  e = ½(u_t² + c²u_x²)  [kinetic + potential]

  ENERGY FLUX:     j = −c²u_t u_x

  CONSERVATION LAW:  ∂e/∂t + ∂j/∂x = 0   (energy flux balance)

  TOTAL ENERGY:  E(t) = ∫_{−∞}^{∞} e(x,t) dx = CONSTANT (if u₀, v₀ ∈ L²)

  This conservation means the wave equation is TIME-REVERSIBLE.
  Run t → −t: wave equation is unchanged (unlike heat equation).
  A wave packet moving right becomes a wave packet moving left.
```

  DOMAIN OF DEPENDENCE of (x₀,t₀):
    D(x₀,t₀) = {(x,0) : |x−x₀| ≤ ct₀}
    Changing u₀ outside this interval → no effect at (x₀,t₀).

  DOMAIN OF INFLUENCE of (x₀,0):
    I(x₀) = {(x,t) : |x−x₀| ≤ ct, t≥0}
    A disturbance at x₀ can only influence inside this forward cone.

  CAUSALITY = FINITE DOMAIN OF INFLUENCE.
  This is exactly relativistic causality when c = speed of light.

## 3D Wave Equation: Kirchhoff's Formula

In 3D, the solution to the wave equation with initial data is given by averages over
expanding spheres — a beautiful result with no 2D analogue:

```
  3D WAVE EQUATION:  u_tt = c²∇²u  in R³

  KIRCHHOFF'S FORMULA:
  u(x,t) = ∂/∂t [t · M_{ct}(u₀)(x)] + t · M_{ct}(v₀)(x)

  where M_r(f)(x) = average of f on sphere of radius r centered at x:
        M_r(f)(x) = 1/(4πr²) ∫_{|y|=r} f(x+y) dσ(y)

  Equivalently:
  u(x,t) = 1/(4πc²t²) ∫_{|y-x|=ct} [t·v₀(y) + u₀(y) + ∇u₀(y)·(y-x)] dσ(y)

  KEY FACT (Huygens' Principle in 3D):
  u(x,t) depends ONLY on data on the sphere |y−x| = ct.
  NOT on data inside the sphere.

  A sharp initial pulse → sharp wavefront in 3D.
  Echo: distant signal arrives and leaves cleanly.
```

### Huygens' Principle: Dimension Dependence

```
  ODD DIMENSIONS (1D, 3D, 5D,...):  STRONG Huygens' principle holds.
    Signal has a sharp front AND sharp back.
    After the wavefront passes, signal returns to zero.
    ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │  3D: u(x,t) depends only on data on sphere |y−x|=ct   │
    │  (thin shell, not ball)                                │
    └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  EVEN DIMENSIONS (2D, 4D,...):  WEAK Huygens' principle.
    Signal has a sharp front but diffuse back.
    2D: u(x,t) depends on data in DISK |y−x| ≤ ct.
    A "splash" in a pond sends a wave that diffuses behind it.

  PRACTICAL CONSEQUENCE:
  Sound in 3D: you hear a gun shot cleanly (sharp front and back).
  Sound in a 2D waveguide: you hear a reverberant tail.
```

## Separation of Variables: Standing Waves

On a finite domain with Dirichlet BCs:

```
  u_tt = c²u_xx,  u(0,t) = u(L,t) = 0,  u(x,0) = u₀(x),  u_t(x,0) = v₀(x)

  STEP 1: Separation.  u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)
          X(x)T''(t) = c²X''(x)T(t)
          T''/c²T = X''/X = −λ  (separation constant)

  STEP 2: X eigenvalue problem.
          X'' + λX = 0,  X(0) = X(L) = 0
          Eigenvalues:   λ_n = (nπ/L)²
          Eigenfunctions: X_n(x) = sin(nπx/L)

  STEP 3: T equation.
          T'' + c²λ_n T = 0  →  T_n(t) = A_n cos(ω_n t) + B_n sin(ω_n t)
          where ω_n = cnπ/L  (angular frequency of nth mode)

  STEP 4: General solution.
          u(x,t) = Σ_{n=1}^∞ [A_n cos(ω_n t) + B_n sin(ω_n t)] sin(nπx/L)

  STEP 5: Apply ICs (Fourier series coefficients):
          A_n = 2/L ∫₀ᴸ u₀(x) sin(nπx/L) dx
          B_n = 2/(Lω_n) ∫₀ᴸ v₀(x) sin(nπx/L) dx

  NORMAL MODES: each term is a standing wave with frequency ω_n = cnπ/L.
  Fundamental frequency ω₁ = cπ/L, overtones at integer multiples.
  Musical string: higher modes give harmonics.
```

## Reflection and Transmission

When a wave hits a boundary between two media:

```
  BOUNDARY at x=0:  c₁ (x<0) and c₂ (x>0)

  INCIDENT wave u_i = f(x − c₁t) (right-moving)
  REFLECTED wave u_r = g(x + c₁t) (left-moving)
  TRANSMITTED wave u_t = h(x − c₂t) (right-moving)

  MATCHING CONDITIONS at x=0:
  (1) Continuity of u:       f(−c₁t) + g(c₁t) = h(−c₂t)
  (2) Continuity of ρc·u_t: ρ₁c₁[−f'(−c₁t) + g'(c₁t)] = ρ₂c₂[−h'(−c₂t)]

  IMPEDANCES: Z_i = ρ_i c_i

  REFLECTION COEFFICIENT: R = (Z₁−Z₂)/(Z₁+Z₂)
  TRANSMISSION COEFFICIENT: T = 2Z₁/(Z₁+Z₂)

  Check: if Z₁ = Z₂ (matched impedances), R=0, T=1 — perfect transmission.
  If Z₂ → ∞ (rigid wall): R = −1 — perfect reflection, sign flip.
  If Z₂ → 0 (free end): R = +1 — perfect reflection, same sign.
```

## Dispersive Waves

Not all waves travel at the same speed. Dispersive waves have frequency-dependent speed:

```
  LINEAR WAVE with dispersion:  u_tt + α²u_xxxx = 0  (beam vibration)

  Plane wave ansatz:  u = e^{i(kx − ωt)}
  Dispersion relation: ω² = α²k⁴  →  ω = αk²  (phase velocity ω/k = αk)

  Different wavelengths travel at different speeds.
  Initial packet spreads out (disperses).

  Compare with non-dispersive (wave eq.): ω² = c²k²  →  ω/k = c
  All wavelengths travel at same speed c.
  Initial packet travels without deformation.

  GROUP VELOCITY: v_g = dω/dk
  PHASE VELOCITY: v_p = ω/k

  Non-dispersive: v_g = v_p = c.
  Dispersive: v_g ≠ v_p in general.
  Energy travels at group velocity.

  KdV is dispersive + nonlinear: balance gives SOLITONS (see below).
```

## Maxwell's Equations as a Hyperbolic System

```
  MAXWELL IN VACUUM:
  ∂B/∂t = −∇×E
  ∂E/∂t = c²∇×B
  ∇·E = 0
  ∇·B = 0

  This is a SYMMETRIC HYPERBOLIC SYSTEM for (E,B) ∈ R⁶.
  Characteristic speeds: 0 (static modes) and ±c (light speed).

  From Maxwell → wave equations for E and B separately:
  ∂²E/∂t² = c²∇²E  (using ∇×(∇×E) = ∇(∇·E) − ∇²E = −∇²E)

  So each component of E (and B) satisfies the 3D wave equation.
  Light is a solution to the wave equation. That's it.

  TRANSVERSE NATURE:
  The constraints ∇·E = 0, ∇·B = 0 (no magnetic monopoles)
  restrict to transverse waves (E,B perpendicular to propagation direction k).
  Plane wave: E ⊥ k, B ⊥ k, E ⊥ B.
```

---

## Nonlinear Wave Equations and Solitons

### KdV: The Canonical Soliton Equation

```
  KdV: u_t + 6u·u_x + u_xxx = 0

  DISPERSION (from linear part u_t + u_xxx = 0):
  Plane wave e^{i(kx−ωt)}: dispersion relation ω = k³  (strongly dispersive)
  Short waves are faster than long waves.

  NONLINEARITY (from 6u·u_x):
  Steepens waves. Without dispersion: shocks form.

  BALANCE: For a certain relationship, steepening and spreading cancel.
  → SOLITON: a wave that propagates without change of shape.

  ONE-SOLITON:  u(x,t) = 2κ² sech²(κ(x − 4κ²t))
  Speed:  v = 4κ². Taller solitons move faster.

  COLLISION OF SOLITONS:
  Two solitons of different speeds collide, pass through each other,
  and emerge unchanged — except for a phase shift.
  This is extraordinary: nonlinear waves that behave like particles.

  MATHEMATICAL DEPTH: KdV is completely integrable (Lax pair,
  inverse scattering transform). Infinitely many conservation laws.
```

## Common Confusion Points

**"The wave equation is hyperbolic, so it has characteristics. Can information really travel
at exactly c, never faster?"**
Yes — for the linear wave equation in homogeneous media, the domain of dependence is exactly
the light cone. This is the mathematical content of special relativity: the wave equation for
the electromagnetic potential is Lorentz-invariant, and the characteristic speed is c.

**"What's the difference between group velocity and phase velocity?"**
Phase velocity v_p = ω/k is the speed of the wavecrest (constant phase surface).
Group velocity v_g = dω/dk is the speed of the envelope / energy packet.
For non-dispersive (ω = ck): v_g = v_p = c.
For deep water waves (ω = √(gk)): v_p = √(g/k), v_g = ½√(g/k) — energy moves at half
the phase speed. This is why wave crests seem to appear at the back of a ship's wake and
disappear at the front.

**"Huygens' principle says a disturbance in 3D leaves no 'afterglow'. Is that really true?"**
Yes, for the scalar wave equation in flat 3D space. The sharp-back property is Huygens'
principle in its strong form. It fails in: curved spacetime, waveguides, inhomogeneous media,
and (deliberately) for 2D membranes. The mathematical statement: the fundamental solution
(Green's function) of the 3D wave equation is supported on the light cone, not inside it.
